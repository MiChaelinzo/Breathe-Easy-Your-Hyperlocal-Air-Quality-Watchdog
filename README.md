##### 🛰️📡 Imagine having real-time, hyperlocal air quality information at your fingertips. Breathe Easy leverages the power of NASA's Earthdata API to provide you with up-to-the-minute insights into the air you breathe. Our platform analyzes data from various atmospheric sensors, including AIRS and MLS, to deliver personalized air quality reports and forecasts directly to your smartphone. Whether you're planning a jog, scheduling outdoor activities with your kids, or just want peace of mind, Breathe Easy empowers you to make informed decisions for a healthier life.  🌍

## 💨 Breathe Easy: Your Hyperlocal Air Quality Watchdog

### 🌃 Inspiration 

We were inspired to create Breathe Easy after experiencing firsthand the lack of accessible and localized air quality information. Existing apps often provide broad regional data that doesn't accurately reflect the air quality in specific neighborhoods or areas. We wanted to empower individuals with precise, real-time data to make informed decisions about their health and well-being.

### 🍃 What it does

Breathe Easy utilizes the power of NASA's Earthdata API to deliver hyperlocal air quality reports directly to your smartphone. By analyzing data from multiple atmospheric sensors, including AIRS, MLS, and MOPITT, our app provides:

- **Real-time air quality index (AQI) readings:** Understand the current air quality in your immediate vicinity.
- **Personalized alerts:** Receive notifications when air quality levels reach unhealthy thresholds.
- **Interactive maps:** Visualize air quality patterns and identify areas with better air.
- **Forecasting:** Plan outdoor activities with confidence using our short-term air quality forecasts.

### 🔨 How we built it

We built Breathe Easy using a combination of:

- **Python:** To access and process data from NASA's Earthdata API.
- **JavaScript (React Native):** For developing the cross-platform mobile application.
- **Data visualization libraries:** To create interactive and informative maps and charts.
- **Cloud infrastructure:** For hosting and scaling our application.

### 🛰️ Challenges we ran into

- **Data integration:** Combining data from various NASA sensors with different formats and resolutions was challenging. 
- **Real-time updates:** Maintaining up-to-date air quality information required efficient data processing and server management.
- **User interface design:** Creating an intuitive and engaging user experience for a data-driven app presented unique design considerations.

### 👽 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- **Successfully integrated and processed complex NASA data:** We overcame the technical hurdles of accessing and analyzing data from multiple sources.
- **Developed a user-friendly mobile application:** Our intuitive interface makes it easy for anyone to understand and use air quality data.
- **Created a valuable tool for public health:** Breathe Easy empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their exposure to air pollution.

### 📚What we learned

- **The importance of data accessibility:** Publicly available data, like NASA's Earthdata, can be used to create impactful applications.
- **The power of collaboration:** Working together allowed us to overcome challenges and achieve our goals.
- **The need for hyperlocal information:** Broad regional data is often insufficient for making informed health decisions.

### 🚀👨🏻‍🚀🧑🏻‍🚀 What's next for Breathe Easy: Your Hyperlocal Air Quality Watchdog

- **Expanding sensor coverage:** Integrating data from additional sensors to enhance accuracy and provide a more comprehensive view of air quality.
- **Personalized health recommendations:** Providing tailored advice based on individual health profiles and air quality conditions.
- **Community engagement:**  Building a platform for users to share their experiences and contribute to a network of air quality awareness.
